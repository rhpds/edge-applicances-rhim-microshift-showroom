= Module 1: Foundation: Concepts & Setup

[#welcome]
== 1.1 Welcome & Lab Objectives
Welcome to the hands-on lab for building and managing edge appliances. In this session, you will explore how RHEL Image Mode (bootc) and MicroShift simplify delivering consistent, reliable, and fully self-contained edge systems.

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
* Build a self-contained appliance using RHEL Image Mode (bootc).
* Deploy cloud-native applications with MicroShift.
* Embed application containers directly into a bootable OS image for disconnected environments.
* Generate a bootable ISO from a container image and deploy it on a KVM virtual machine.
* Perform atomic, image-based system upgrades and rollbacks.

[NOTE]
The entire lab environment is already prepared for you. Your build host has the required tools installed, MicroShift bundles are available, and the sample application content is included in the lab repository.

[#edge_challenge]
== 1.2 The Edge Challenge & The RHEL Image Mode Solution
Edge systems often run in tough, inconsistent environments. Common challenges include:
* *Configuration Drift:* Systems slowly diverge from their intended state.
* *Risky Updates:* Traditional update methods can break systems in the field.
* *Disconnected Locations:* Many devices have intermittent or no network connectivity.

**RHEL Image Mode** addresses these challenges by treating the *entire* OS as an immutable, versioned image. Instead of updating individual packages, you deploy a new OS image exactly like updating a container.

[#bootc]
== 1.3 Introducing RHEL Image Mode (bootc)
RHEL Image Mode, backed by **bootc**, replaces traditional package-based management with an “image-first” workflow.

Key benefits:
* **Atomic updates:** The whole system updates in one operation.
* **Rollback safety:** A previous working version is always available.
* **Consistency:** Every device boots from the same known-good image.
* **Simplicity:** Build, ship, and manage appliances like container images.

This model is ideal for appliances, remote edge clusters, industrial gateways, and environments where reliability outweighs customization.

[#workflow]
== 1.4 The Build-Deploy-Manage Workflow
A typical Image Mode workflow looks like this:

. Define your OS + application layers inside a `Containerfile`.
. Build a bootable container image from that specification.
. Generate an ISO or disk image from the container image.
. Deploy the image to target edge systems or VMs.
. Manage updates by shipping new container image versions.

[NOTE]
In this lab, the application (WordPress + MySQL) and MicroShift components are already provided. You will see how they can all be included directly inside the OS image.

[#setup]
== 1.5 Hands-On: Environment Setup
Your environment includes:
* A **build host** (where you run all commands).
* A **prepared folder structure** with `Containerfile` examples and helper scripts.
* A **sample workload** (WordPress) ready to be deployed on MicroShift.
* A **target VM** that will be created later to boot your generated appliance image.

To begin, clone the lab repository that contains all the files you will work with:

. Clone the lab repository:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
git clone https://github.com/redhat-gpte-devops-enablement/bootc-embedded-containers.git
----

. Change into the repository directory:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cd bootc-embedded-containers
----

[NOTE]
No additional configuration is required. All needed tools, container runtime settings, and supporting files are already present in the lab environment.
