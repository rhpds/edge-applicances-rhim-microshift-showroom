= Module 1: Foundation: Concepts & Setup

[#welcome]
== 1.1 Welcome & Lab Objectives
Welcome to the hands-on lab for building and managing edge appliances. The primary goal of this lab is to demonstrate how to build a self-contained appliance using RHEL Image Mode (bootc) and deploy cloud-native applications with MicroShift.

Upon completion of this lab, you will be able to:
* Build a self-contained appliance using RHEL Image Mode (bootc).
* Deploy Cloud Native Applications with MicroShift.
* Embed application containers directly into the bootable OS image for disconnected scenarios.
* Generate a bootable ISO from a container image and deploy it on a KVM virtual machine.
* Perform atomic, image-based system upgrades on a live system.

[#edge_challenge]
== 1.2 The Edge Challenge & The RHEL Image Mode Solution
Managing edge devices presents several challenges, including:
* *Configuration Drift:* Systems diverge from their intended state over time.
* *Risky Updates:* Applying updates in the field can lead to system failures.
* *Disconnected Environments:* Many edge devices operate in locations with limited or no network connectivity.

RHEL Image Mode provides a solution to these problems by treating the entire operating system as a single, immutable image.

[#bootc]
== 1.3 Introducing RHEL Image Mode (bootc)
RHEL Image Mode, powered by `bootc`, represents a shift from traditional "Package Mode" to a modern "Image Mode." Instead of managing individual packages, you manage the entire OS as a versioned, bootable container image.

Key benefits include:
* *Speed:* Rapidly deploy and update systems.
* *Reliability:* Atomic updates and rollbacks ensure system stability.
* *Security:* Reduced attack surface and protection against configuration drift.
* *Simplicity:* Simplified appliance creation and management.

== 1.4 The Build-Deploy-Manage Workflow & Use Cases
The workflow for RHEL Image Mode is straightforward:
. Create a `Containerfile` that defines your OS and application layers.
. Build the `Containerfile` into a bootable container image.
. Push the image to a container registry.
. Deploy the image to your edge devices.
. Manage updates by pulling new image versions.

This model is ideal for edge appliances, IoT devices, and any scenario requiring robust, remotely managed systems.
