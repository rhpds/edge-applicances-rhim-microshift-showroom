== 5.1 Know: Connecting the Dots — Problem → Capability → Outcome

Throughout this workshop, we demonstrated how **bootc + MicroShift** solve ManufacturingCo's real-world problems end-to-end.

=== Workshop Journey Summary

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
| Module | Capability Demonstrated | Business Outcome
| **1. Challenges** | bootc Architecture | Shift from mutable packages to **immutable images**.
| **2. Building** | Physically-bound bootable images | Appliances that are **fully self-contained** for air-gapped sites.
| **3. Deploying** | ISO-based offline deployment | Reliable, **reproducible installation** without registry access.
| **4. Updating** | Atomic A/B updates & Greenboot | Safe updates with **instant rollback**, eliminating field risk.

[#quantified_outcomes]
== 5.2 Know: Business Outcomes

The transition to bootc transforms edge operations from "pets" to "cattle." Below are the key improvements that organizations typically realize when adopting bootc for edge appliances.

=== Operational Efficiency Matrix

[cols="1,1a,1a,1", options="header"]
|===
| Metric | Traditional Method | bootc Method | Impact
| **Deployment Speed** | 6–8 weeks per location | Days | **Significantly faster deployment cycles**
| **Build Complexity** | Manual, bespoke scripts | Versioned `Containerfile` | **Simplified build process with version control**
| **Update Stability** | 15% failure rate | <1% failure rate | **Dramatically reduced update failures**
| **System Drift** | 30% drift over 6 months | **0% Drift** (Immutable) | **Eliminates configuration drift**
|===



=== Strategic Advantages

* **Enhanced Security:** Immutable images provide a consistent, tamper-resistant security posture across the entire fleet.
* **Disconnected Success:** Directory-based upgrades enable high-tech operations in locations with zero internet connectivity.
* **Fleet Management:** Use Git-like versioning for both the OS and workloads, enabling predictable, fleet-wide rollouts.
