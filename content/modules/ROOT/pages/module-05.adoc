== 5.1 Know: Connecting the Dots — Problem → Capability → Outcome

Throughout this workshop, we walked through the **real-world problems** ManufacturingCo faces and demonstrated how **RHEL Image Mode + MicroShift** solve them end to end.

Below is a summary of each module’s role in that journey.

=== Module 1: Understanding Edge Challenges

**Customer Pain:**  
Edge appliances drift out of compliance, updates break systems, and environments are hard to manage due to constraints (network, physical, organizational).

**Solution Introduced:**  
RHEL Image Mode treats the **entire OS as an immutable image** — not a mutable package stack.

**Outcome for the Business:**  
Participants understood *why* managing traditional edge systems is hard and *how* image-based operations unlock consistency and repeatability.

=== Module 2: Building Self-Contained Appliances

**Customer Pain:**  
Disconnected or intermittent networks make traditional updates impractical or impossible.

**Solution Introduced:**  
Build **physically-bound bootable images** that embed MicroShift + workload containers.

**Outcome for the Business:**  
Participants built an appliance that brings everything it needs with it — perfect for air-gapped factories.

=== Module 3: Deploying to Edge Locations

**Customer Pain:**  
“How do we reliably deploy appliances to dozens or hundreds of remote sites?”

**Solution Introduced:**  
ISO-based deployment onto isolated networks — proving the runtime consumes **only** embedded images.

**Outcome for the Business:**  
Participants confirmed the appliance **runs fully offline**, solving the deployment-to-anywhere challenge.

=== Module 4: Safe Updates & Rollbacks

**Customer Pain:**  
Update failures require on-site IT visits with hours of downtime.

**Solution Introduced:**  
**Atomic A/B updates + instant rollback + greenboot verification.**

**Outcome for the Business:**  
Participants performed a safe update, validated system health, and rolled back instantly — eliminating field risk.

=== The Complete Picture

Across the modules, we solved core edge challenges:

* **Configuration Drift →** Immutable images, reproducible builds  
* **Risky Updates →** Atomic updates + automatic rollback  
* **Disconnected Operations →** Embedded images + offline ISO deployment  
* **Limited On-Site Skills →** Zero-touch installation and recovery  
* **Scale & Lifecycle Complexity →** Container-style workflows and versioning

The takeaway:  
**Image Mode and MicroShift transform edge operations from “pets to cattle,” enabling predictable, repeatable, fleet-centric management.**

== 5.2 Know: Quantified Business Outcomes

Below are the measurable improvements ManufacturingCo — and customers like them — can realize.

=== Accelerate Time-to-Market

* **From:** 6–8 weeks per location  
* **To:** Days  
* **Impact:** 75% faster time-to-value  

Enabled by:  
Containerfile-based builds · ISO deployment · atomic updates

=== Simplify Appliance Creation

* **From:** Manual multi-step build + bespoke scripts  
* **To:** Single version-controlled Containerfile  
* **Impact:** 80% reduction in build complexity

=== Streamline Field Operations

* **From:** 15% update failure rates + site visits  
* **To:** Automatic rollback + 0-touch recovery  
* **Impact:** 90% reduction in downtime & support cost

=== Enhance Security

* **From:** Drift, inconsistent patching, unmanaged packages  
* **To:** Immutable images with embedded security  
* **Impact:** Consistent security posture across fleet

=== Enable Disconnected Deployments

* **From:** Registry-dependent updates  
* **To:** Self-contained images + directory-based upgrades  
* **Impact:** Deploy & upgrade anywhere, online or offline

=== Manage Fleets at Scale

* **From:** Snowflake systems, configuration sprawl  
* **To:** Git-like versioning for OS + workloads  
* **Impact:** Predictable rollouts, consistent versions everywhere

=== ManufacturingCo’s Before & After

**Before adopting Image Mode**

* 6–8 week rollout cadence  
* 15% updates failing in the field  
* 30% drift over 6 months  
* On-site IT required to recover  
* Security posture inconsistent

**After adopting Image Mode**

* **Deploy + update in days**
* **<1% update failures**
* **0% drift — immutable images**
* **Instant rollback — seconds, not hours**
* **Same known-good image everywhere**

RHEL Image Mode replaced:

* Traditional mutable systems  

with  

* predictable, portable, safe, versioned appliances
