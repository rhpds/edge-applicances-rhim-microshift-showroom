= Module 3: Deploying and Verifying the Appliance

[#boot_vm]
== 3.1 Hands-On: Create and Boot a Test VM
With the bootable ISO created, you will now create a KVM virtual machine and boot it from the ISO. 

. Create a new VM and boot from the `v1` ISO. 

Once the VM has booted, log in and perform the following checks to verify the system status.

. Check the immutable system status:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
sudo bootc status
----

. Verify that the WordPress and MySQL pods are running:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -A
----

. Confirm that the embedded container images are being used:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
sudo crictl images
----

[#manifests]
== 3.2 Overview of the WordPress Application Manifests
The WordPress application is deployed using standard Kubernetes manifests. These files define the deployments, services, and persistent volumes required for the application to run.

. Review the kustomization file to see how the manifests are organized:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat manifests/kustomization.yaml
----

. Inspect the WordPress deployment manifest:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat manifests/wordpress.yaml
----
